## ðŸ•¹ Usage

### Use the CDN

The quickest and easiest way to start include the CDN hosted file in the `<head>` of your html file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@awesomecss/animations@0.0.2/dist/animations.min.css" />
```


### Using npm/yarn

You can add this library to your node workflow by running:

```
npm install @awesomecss/animations --save
```

It'll be up to you to include/import either the `.scss` files (within `/src/`) or the compiled `.css` files (within `/dist`) with your project's set up.
